React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all about on our homepage

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. 
Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a 
complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

**What is Babel?**

Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible 
version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers.
These plugins allow you to use new syntax, right now without waiting for browser support. 

* Babel can convert JSX syntax!

**What is JSX**

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. 
JSX allows us to write HTML in React. 
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods. 
* JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

**What is ReactDOM.render()**

ReactDOM. render() controls the contents of the container node you pass in. Any existing DOM elements inside are replaced when first called. 
Later calls use React's DOM diffing algorithm for efficient updates.

ReactDOM.render() currently returns a reference to the root ReactComponent instance. 
However, using this return value is legacy and should be avoided because future versions of React may render components asynchronously in some cases. 
If you need a reference to the root ReactComponent instance, the preferred solution is to attach a callback ref to the root element.
